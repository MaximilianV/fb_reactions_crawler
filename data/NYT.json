But the fans? Not so much. At least if you go by Rotten Tomatoes, which says moviegoers rated it 56% fresh.\n\nBut wait! CinemaScore, which conducts exit polls at theaters (that is, it reaches actual, live beings), says moviegoers gave \"The Last Jedi\"  a solid A. And the box office was stratospheric.\n\nWhat's going on? There are several theories. \n\n1) It's straight up trolling. Deadline says nothing prevents the same person from logging on repeatedly to Rotten Tomatoes and dragging down the audience score (and one Facebook user claims to have done just that).\n\n 2) The adventures of Rey and company were genuinely disappointing. The Hollywood Reporter notes that anticipation was running high that the follow-up to \"The Force Awakens\" would explain who Rey's parents are, and the answer (nobody special) wasn't very satisfying.  \n\n 3) It's a function of how the internet has affected fandom.
